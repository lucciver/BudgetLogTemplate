# BudgetLogTemplate
A customizeable spreadsheet for your financing - made with Google Sheets.


## How to actually use this thing.

### Adding Stuff
You can add more than what is shown on here. To add a category, go over to the right, where all the other ones are. Then, you add a collum to the left or right, and putting in information. Afterwards don't forget to update the info on the income and spending graphs! You do this by changing the letters in its range. Last, you go to the data validation (which is in the data section) and add your category - as well as adding the ":(Letter)" to make it continually going down. In addition, you can also make an average of your finances (if you decide to make sheets for each year) by making a new sheet and creating an "array" of all the sheets with graphs to show you the total. You can find out how to do that by looking at Google's tutorials.

### Plugging In Stuff
Before anything is said, count the amount of money you have, putting it in the first row and selecting it as "Recount/Correction" and marking it as an income. Anyways - to use this, write in the day you had a transaction, select the category, specify whether it was an income, spending, or an investment - as well as putting in the remianing information. At the end, you will notice a box that says "Effect." This will help graph the amount of money gained and spent over time. After each input, click on the box and drag the circle (when your cursor is over the bottom right corner) downward for the formula to take it's effect.

### Investment(s)
The investment feature is completely optional, but it can help you make sure you are not using any of the money you set aside. It is similar to plugging info in for spending or recieving money. Here's the categories that are identified as an investment on this template: "College","Emergency Fund", and "Savings". Whenever you add your first investment, it will show up as a dot on the graph. This is a marker to show you the distance from your *overall* total. At the top left corner of the spreadsheet you can find the total you have without your investment(s). If you want to lower the amount, select the reason as a recount and put in a negative number. If you want to take money out of your investment, do the same as before and also enter in a new row for "Spent."

These boxes are color coded for our convenience. Boxes from D4-D1000 should be unprotected for you to add your thoughts. Please include a date when you write anything. When comments are resolved, they will be deleted. Comment in the box closest to D3 avaliable to be noticed.

NOTE: *This is not necessarily compatible with Microsoft Excel. If you have any idea how it can work or transfer over without freaking out, feel free to let me know. It may also come to you that an app may be better to use than this. Well, this obviously does not invade your privacy; and you can carry this with you on your flash drive or storage. If you have it downloaded/saved onto your device, you won't have to use service, either!* Eventually, this account will shut down. When the time comes, and if I care enough or remember, I should move all this data to another account and re-share this.
